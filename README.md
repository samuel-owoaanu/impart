A simple file sharing program using websockets in python

Use the generate_ssl_certs.sh to create local ssl certs that will be used in the program for encrypted communication.


The program should be running on the devices that intend to share file within the network.

Note; this program is ideal for local communication, not really fine-tuned to a wider scope, contributions are welcome!

Peace.
